# Tanabata

This github is for KVIS Tanabata website 2023 (7 July)
Note for other developers:
- This website use HTML, CSS, Java as the main structure.
- Google sheet as database (which kinda sad). Note that firebase would be more appreciate next time :)
- In story telling section we did not used the "viewport meta tag" so the popup might be too big when the user open with their smart phone (but the proportion works in ipad and laptop tho)
